An analysis by the Coverity Scanner is run occasionally against the source of
netsniff-ng. The corresponding scan reports can be found here:

  https://scan.coverity.com/projects/329

If you are a project admin, use the command

  `make COV_EMAIL=<email> COV_PASSWD=<passwd> coverity'

to trigger a new scan yourself.
